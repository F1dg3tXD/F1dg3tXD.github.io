        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Primative: Your 3D Web Workspace from 2005!</p>
        <p>The interface of this particular web app could be described as archaic and retro, with a focus on direct value manipulation as a key feature. Every detail is highly deliberate, from the overall aesthetic to the minutest of details. The interface may feel somewhat dated, but it's by design - every feature has been carefully crafted to give users direct control over values and parameters. You won't find any fancy animations or excessive visual flair here - instead, you'll be able to dive straight into manipulating values and achieving precise results. This approach may not be for everyone, but for those who value the ability to manipulate values with precision, this archaic and retro interface could prove to be a highly effective tool.</p>
